<summary>About</summary>
<p>Kin was a series of mobile phones that Microsoft promoted in 2010 for a short time. They were made specifically for those within the age group of 15 to 30, focusing largely on social networking. With its goal solely on promoting their own social media as Kin, they had Kin Loop, A live social feed that constantly updated with friends' posts and Kin Spot which was a platform where users were able to send photos, videos, and links to each other. The main reason it failed was due to the lack of platforms as it did not support android play store nor app store. It being a device where people can only contact if they own the same device was a bad approach to gaining sales on an expensive mobile device, limiting the users preferences.</p>

  <h2>Microsoft Courier</h2>

<summary>About</summary>
<p>Microsoft courier was an experimental idea (prototype) from Microsoft for creating a tablet with two digital screens. This gadget was visualized as a digital notebook, made up of two 7-inch touch-sensitive screens joined together like a book. It operated on unique software specifically created to favor handwritten inputs and keep notes, pictures, and snippets captured from web pages in the manner of a diary. This device was created for the perfect way of studying and doing multitasking work. As it also had a modern/futuristic design during 2008 we could only imagine how much this device could have advanced in today's era. Unfortunately, in 2010, Microsoft said the project was over and they had no present intention of making this type of device shifting their focus and priorities to Windows advancements.</p>

It not only enhances our vision like glasses but also include software advances by providing real-time us with real-time information just like a modern digital phone. If they were to bring this back along with all our modern tech like AI, it could potentially become a useful tool that can help support not only our daily lives but may also detect unknown illnesses. Although everything sounds cool, this idea has already been around for over a decade and still nowhere near official launch nor a possibility for future launch. They consists of many issues like safety and software concerns, and the overall design of the tech which is left behind as of now... </p>
