  <h2> Ouya</h2>

<details>
<summary>About</summary>
<p>The Ouya was a Kick Starter funded Andriod based gaming console that launched in 2013. Some of its major selling points is: being affordable with its MSRP being $99 dollars, Friendly for indie developers, and it's "Free to try" game model where you can try the game for a short period before buying it. The main reason why the Ouya failed was it being really underpowered as it was basically just a phone without a touch screen. That also mean that most of the games it had were Andriod games found in the Play Store. This meant that a lot of major game studious didn't really want to support it, leading to a lack of any major game libraries. In 2015, Razer bought Ouya for its software and ceased all of its Hardware developments and eventually in 2019, its online store was shutdown completely.   </p>

  <p>In a desperate attempt to gain more developers for their console, they launched a fund where they will match Kickstarter funds for any Ouya exclusive games that raised at least 50,000 dollars, but many game developers took advantage of this and pretended they were delveloping a game for the Ouya so thay they would get free money. </p>

  <h2> Toshiba's HD DVD</h2>
  <p>Click below to learn more</p>
<details>
<summary>About</summary>
<p>As the early 2000s made High-Definition TVs more mainstream, DVDs became obsolete as its limiations to only hold up to 480p was not enough to display higher resolution demand. This is where the demand fora new format to emerge in the market, two of the main products were Toshiba's HD DVD and Sony's Blu-ray. Toshiba's HD DVD was built upon the original DVD technology and used a blue laser instead of a red one for higher data density. What made the HD DVD to be abandoned was due to its competition with Blu-ray where Sony used it's Playstation 3 game platform to have a built in Blu-ray reader, making it one of the cheapest Blu-ray players in the market at the time. Another major reason is due to many Hollywood studios such as Warner Bros, Disney, and 20th Century FOX dropping HD DVD in support Blu-ray exclusively. This lack to support of the movie industry eventually lead to retailers to not stock their shelves as there was no demand, leading to its demise in 2008. </p>

  <h2> Microsoft Kin</h2>

<details>
<summary>About</summary>
<p>Kin was a series of mobile phones that Microsoft promoted in 2010 for a short time. They were made specifically for those within the age group of 15 to 30, focusing largely on social networking. With its goal solely on promoting their own social media as Kin, they had Kin Loop, A live social feed that constantly updated with friends' posts and Kin Spot which was a platform where users were able to send photos, videos, and links to each other. The main reason it failed was due to the lack of platforms as it did not support android play store nor app store. It being a device where people can only contact if they own the same device was a bad approach to gaining sales on an expensive mobile device, limiting the users preferences.</p>

  <h2>Microsoft Courier</h2>
  <p>Click below to learn more</p>
<details>
<summary>About</summary>
<p>Microsoft courier was an experimental idea (prototype) from Microsoft for creating a tablet with two digital screens. This gadget was visualized as a digital notebook, made up of two 7-inch touch-sensitive screens joined together like a book. It operated on unique software specifically created to favor handwritten inputs and keep notes, pictures, and snippets captured from web pages in the manner of a diary. This device was created for the perfect way of studying and doing multitasking work. As it also had a modern/futuristic design during 2008 we could only imagine how much this device could have advanced in today's era. Unfortunately, in 2010, Microsoft said the project was over and they had no present intention of making this type of device shifting their focus and priorities to Windows advancements.</p>
